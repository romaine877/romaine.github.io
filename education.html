            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
              I'm only making this site to polish my skills, I need a job, I need money
              to buy a new laptop and I also want to build up my resume inorder to ensure
              I will be employed once I leave university. In the future, I would like to
              see myself as an IT Project Manager or Information Security Officer- though I
              have a lot to earn in that field. But even more, I would ove to become an
              IT auditor or an IT consultant. Having a career in either of those fields
              would make me quite happy. My end goal is to become a CIO of a large company.
